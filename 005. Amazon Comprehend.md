<h2>What problems does Amazon Comprehend solve?</h2>
<p><strong>Amazon Comprehend is an NLP</strong> service that uses <strong>machine learning (ML)</strong> to uncover valuable insights and relationships in text. With Amazon Comprehend, you do not need ML expertise to build intelligent applications.<br><br>
Many NLP use cases can be solved using pre-trained Amazon Comprehend models, rather than creating new ones. Amazon Comprehend offers simple APIs to interact with and models that are continuously trained to increase accuracy. Amazon Comprehend has pre-trained models that can do the following:<br><br>
. Identify entities such as person, organization, quantity, location, or event.<br>
. Analyze text for speciÔ¨Åc types of events and their related entities.<br>
. Extract key phrases and determine the language of text.<br>
. Analyze text to understand how positive or negative sentiment is and gain deeper understanding of the sentiments associated with specific entities.<br>
. Parse words from documents to return part of speech or syntactic function for each word in the document.<br>
. Organize a collection of documents by topic automatically.</p>
