<h2> Use Amazon CodeWhisperer to build a complete, end-to-end image recognition and labeling system.</h2>

<br>


<p> This solution uses AWS serverless services to create an end-to-end image recognition and labeling system composed of API stack<br, integration stack and recognition stack. </p>

<p> The system is deployed using the AWS Development Kit (AWS CDK) in those three stacks.</p>

<p> The API stack is composed of an AWS Lambda function that retrieves an image from a web server and stores that image in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.</p>
