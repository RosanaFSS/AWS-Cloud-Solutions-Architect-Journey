<h1>Image Recognition and Labeling System</h1>
<br>
<h3><strong>API stack</strong> : <code>AWS Lambda</code>, <code>AWS CDK</code>, <code>Amazon S3</code>, <code>Amazon SQS</code>, <code>Amazon SNS</code> and <code>API Gateway</code>.</h3>
<br>
<h3><strong>Recognition stack</strong> : <code>AWS Lambda</code>, <code>Amazon DynamoDB</code>, <code>Amazon Rekognition</code>, <code>API Gateway</code>.</h3>

<br>


<p>The system is deployed in three different stacks: <code>API</code>, <code>integration</code> and <code>recognition</code>.<br>
The system is deployed using the AWS Development Kit (AWS CDK) in those three stacks.</p>

<p>The <code>API stack</code> is composed of an AWS Lambda function that retrieves an image from a web server and stores that image in an Amazon S3 bucket.<br>
There is a Lambda function that ia invoked by the user through an API hosted on Amazon API Gateway.<br>
When an image is stored in the S3 bucket, an event notification places a message into an Amazon SNS topic.<br>
The SNS topic then delivers the message to a subscriber Amazon SQS queue.</p>

<br>

<p>The Recognition stack is next in the system. The work item from the API stack SQS queue invokes the image recognition Lambda function.<br>
This Lambda function uses Amazon Rekognition to create labels for the image that is stored in the S3 bucket.<br>
The Lambda function stores these labels in an Amazon DynamoDB table and places a message in the Integration stack SNS topic.<br>
The user can retrieve the labels from an Amazon DynamoDB table by issuing an API call that invokes the list images Lambda function.</p>

<br>

<p>The Integration stack is the final part of the system. When the image recognition Lambda function places a message in the Integration stack SNS topic, the message is delivered to the subscriber SQS queue.<br>
This new work item in the SQS queue invokes the integration Lambda function. The Lambda function converts the message to XML format and sends a POST request to the third-party server via API Gateway.<br>
