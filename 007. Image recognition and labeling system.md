<h2> Image recognition and labeling system</h2>

<br>


<p> The system is composed of three parts: <code>API stack</code>, <code>integration stack</code> and <code>recognition stack</code>. </p>

<p> The system is deployed using the AWS Development Kit (AWS CDK) in those three stacks.</p>

<p> The API stack is composed of an AWS Lambda function that retrieves an image from a web server and stores that image in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.</p>
