<h1> Image Recognition and Labeling System</h1>
<h3> <bold>API stack</bold> : <code>AWS Lambda</code>, <code>AWS CDK</code>, <code>Amazon S3</code>, <code>SQS queue</code>, <code>SNS topic</code> and <code>API Gateway</code></h3>

<br>


<p> The system is composed of three parts: <code>API stack</code>, <code>integration stack</code> and <code>recognition stack</code>. </p>

<p> The system is deployed using the AWS Development Kit (AWS CDK) in those three stacks.</p>

<p> The <code>API stack</code> is composed of an AWS Lambda function that retrieves an image from a web server and stores that image in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.</p>

<p> There is a Lambda function that ia invoked by the user through an API hosted on Amazon API Gateway.</p>

<p> When an image is stored in the S3 bucket, an event notification places a message into an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.</p>
